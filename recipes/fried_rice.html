    <h2>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat.</h2>
    <p>Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup chopped baby carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen green peas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups leftover cooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
