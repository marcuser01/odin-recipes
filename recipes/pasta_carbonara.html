    <h2>Carbonara is a Roman pasta dish made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper.</h2>
    <p>This classic pasta carbonara recipe is smooth, creamy, and full of rich Italian flavor. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale (see Cook's Note). Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy. </li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale. </li>
        <li>Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper. </li>
    </ol>
